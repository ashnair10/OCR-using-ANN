These days there is a huge demand in “storing the information available in these paper documents into a computer storage disk and then later reusing this information for searching process.
One simple way to store these paper documents into computer system is to first scan the documents and then store them as IMAGES. But to reuse this information, it is very difficult to read the individual contents and searching the contents from these documents line-by-line and word-by-word. The reason for this difficulty is the font characteristics of the characters in paper documents are different to font of the characters in computer system. As a result, computer is unable to recognize the characters while reading them.
This is where we use OCR- Optical Character Recognition.
It uses our computer’s smarts to recognize letter shapes in an image or scanned document and turn the into digital text, which can be copied and edited as needed.
